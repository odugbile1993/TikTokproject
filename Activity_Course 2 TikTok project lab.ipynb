    "\n",
    "Observation:\n",
    "Banned authors have significantly higher median views, likes, and shares compared to active authors.\n",
    "Median video views for banned authors: 448,201, vs. 8,616 for active authors.\n",

    "Median shares for banned authors: 14,468, vs. 437 for active authors.\n",
    "Possible Explanations:\n",
    "Controversial Content Drives Engagement:\n",
    "\n",
    "Banned authors might have created viral or controversial content, leading to more interactions before removal.\n",
    "Algorithm Boost Before Ban:\n",
    "\n",

    "Once an account is banned, users might share their videos more as a reaction or protest.\n",
    "Conclusion:\n",
    "Banned accounts tend to have highly engaging content, likely due to their controversial or viral nature. This could explain why their median engagement metrics are so much higher than those of active users.\n",

    "Analysis: Claim Videos vs. Opinion Videos\n",
    "Likes per View:\n",
    "\n",
    "Claim videos generally have a higher likes-per-view ratio compared to opinion videos.\n",
    "For example, active claim videos have a mean likes-per-view of 0.33, whereas active opinion videos have only 0.22.\n",
    "This suggests that claim videos might be more engaging or resonate more with viewers.\n",
    "Comments per View:\n",
    "\n",
    "Claim videos also receive more comments per view than opinion videos.\n",
    "For instance, active claim videos have a mean comments-per-view of 0.001393, whereas active opinion videos have only 0.000517.\n",
    "This could indicate that claim videos encourage more discussion, possibly due to controversy or audience interest.\n",

    "Similar to likes and comments, claim videos are shared more frequently per view than opinion videos.\n",

    "Key Takeaways:\n",
    "Claim videos attract more engagement (likes, comments, and shares) compared to opinion videos.\n",
    "The higher interaction rates suggest that claim videos might be more polarizing, engaging, or emotionally charged, leading to increased participation.\n",
    "Opinion videos, on the other hand, seem to have less viewer interaction, possibly because they are seen as less controversial or engaging."

    "1. Distribution of Claim vs. Opinion Videos\n",
    "Claim videos account for approximately 40% of the dataset, while opinion videos make up 60%.\n",
    "This indicates that opinion videos are more common, but claim videos tend to receive higher engagement levels.\n",
    "2. Factors Correlating with Claim Status\n",
    "Author Ban Status:\n",
    "\n",
    "A notable number of claim videos come from banned or under-review authors, suggesting that claim content may be more controversial or violate platform policies more frequently.\n",
    "Claim videos from banned authors make up a significant portion of the dataset compared to opinion videos from banned authors.\n",
    "Engagement Metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "Claim videos tend to receive more likes, comments, and shares per view compared to opinion videos.\n",
    "This suggests that claim videos may be perceived as more engaging, controversial, or thought-provoking, leading to higher interaction.\n",
    "3. Factors Correlating with Engagement Levels\n",
    "Likes per View:\n",
    "\n",
    "Claim videos have a higher like-per-view ratio than opinion videos, indicating stronger audience resonance.\n",
    "Comments per View:\n",
    "\n",
    "Claim videos also generate more comments per view, suggesting they encourage discussions, debates, or emotional responses.\n",
    "Shares per View:\n",
    "\n",
    "Claim videos are shared more frequently than opinion videos, reinforcing their virality and perceived importance by viewers.\n",
    "Key Takeaways & Recommendations\n",
    "Claim videos drive higher engagement but also have a higher association with banned or restricted authors.\n",
    "TikTok may need to monitor claim videos more closely to identify patterns that lead to policy violations while ensuring that engagement remains organic.\n",
    "Further investigation is needed to determine whether high engagement in claim videos is due to their credibility, controversy, or misinformation potential.\n",
    "Opinion videos, though less engaging, make up a larger portion of content, indicating potential areas to boost interaction through content strategy."
